    "Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. In the diagram below, the red region denotes his house, where s is the start point, and t is the endpoint. The apple tree is to the left of his house, and the orange tree is to its right. You can assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apple tree is at point a, and the orange tree is at point b.\n",
    "When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands d units of distance from its tree of origin along the x-axis. A negative value of d means the fruit fell d units to the tree's left, and a positive value of d means it falls d units to the tree's right.\n",
    "Given the value of d for m apples and n oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range [s,t])?\n",
    "Function Description--\n",
    "Complete the countApplesAndOranges function in the editor below. It should print the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house, each on a separate line.\n",
    "countApplesAndOranges has the following parameter(s):\n",
    "s: integer, starting point of Sam's house location.\n",
    "t: integer, ending location of Sam's house location.\n",
    "a: integer, location of the Apple tree.\n",
    "b: integer, location of the Orange tree.\n",
    "apples: integer array, distances at which each apple falls from the tree.\n",
